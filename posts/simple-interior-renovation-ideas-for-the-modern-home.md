Freshening up the look and feel of your home doesn’t have to involve a full blown renovation. Sometimes a simple alteration or addition can inject the breath of fresh air you’ve been looking for.

Be inspired by our top 5 tips for modern interior renovation projects that are beautiful, affordable and on trend.

## 1. Mixing Old and New 

Feeling frustrated by your old, frumpy house? Or perhaps you feel like your shiny new home is lacking warmth and character? The good news is that the solution to these problems is simple: Contrast. The juxtaposition between vintage and modern is the perfect way to add a trendy spin to your interior. Start small by choosing vintage fabric for some new cushions or a chic and shiny copper lamp for the lounge room. Go bigger by hiring a builder to alter your outdated floor plan with a new, open plan living area.

## 2. Be Multi-functional 

The old rules for home building and renovations simply don’t exist anymore. The lines are blurred and it’s right on trend to give each room a number of different purposes. Kitchens double as dining rooms, bathrooms as workout areas and verandas as extra rooms. Embrace this trend by decorating your home mindfully. Aim to make each room welcoming so you want to stay and enjoy the space rather than just pass through. 

## 3. Go Natural 

In recent years, there has been a shift towards more natural, eco-friendly interiors. It’s time to introduce wood, concrete and textural fabrics into your living space. Think about commissioning a beautiful handmade wooden table or chairs for your dining room. Alternatively, talk to your local builder about a minor renovation that will allow you to bring the outdoors in. Big floor-to-ceiling windows, a deck, or a new outdoor entertainment area can be the perfect way to introduce the beauty of nature into your contemporary home. 

## 4. Embrace Colour and Texture 

Play with colour and texture to make your living spaces aesthetically interesting and trendy. You could plan a DIY project or hire a professional to install a feature wall or a textured splashback. If you’re looking for something a little easier, a pop of colour with a new pillow, throw or shelving backdrop can make all the difference. 

## 5. Light It Up 

Using interesting lighting and making the most of natural light can make your home look more luxurious, spacious and comfortable. Designer lamps or shades are a great way to add colour, style and light to your living areas. You could even go one step further and hire an expert to install a skylight or big open windows to let the sunlight in. You’ll be amazed at the results.

## Forget the Rules

When it comes to interior design and renovation, the rule book is out the window! There’s plenty of ways to ramp up your style, from something simple and easy to a full-scale renovation or alteration. So what are you waiting for? Give one of our tips a try this weekend and enjoy the difference!
